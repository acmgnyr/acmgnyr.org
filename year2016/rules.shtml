<ol>
<li>
Teams will not be given the test input files that the judges will use
to determine program correctness.
 
<li>
Solutions to problems submitted for judging are called
<i>runs</i>. Each run is judged as <i>correct</i> or
incorrect, and the team is notified of the results.
Incorrect runs will be marked with one of the following comments. They
are listed in decreasing order of severity.

<ol>
<li> <i>file naming error</i>: The file naming convention was not
  followed. Either the submission was incorrectly named, or the
  program did not read from / write to the correctly named file.
<li> <i>compile error</i>: The program did not compile.
<li> <i>run-time error</i>: The program did not run to completion.
<li> <i>wrong answer</i>: This means that the program compiled and
  ran, but produced incorrect output.
<li> <i>time limit exceeded</i>: The program did not finish executing
  within the 2 minute time limit.
<li> <i>presentation error</i>: The output was nominally correct, but
  was not in the correct format.
</ol>

<li>
The Contest Judges are solely responsible for determining the correctness
of submitted runs. In consultation with the Contest Judges, the Chief Judge
is responsible for determining the winners of the contest. They
are empowered to adjust for or adjudicate unforeseen events and conditions.
Their decisions are final.

<li> The final contest results will be announced following the contest by the
Contest Director, Site Director, or Head Judge.

<li> Although they are unlikely, the Contest Director will resolve
ties by examining the quality of submitted solutions and number of
incorrect submissions.
