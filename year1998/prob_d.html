<P>We create a cryptogram of some text if we replace each occurence of
the letter <TT>A</TT> by one letter of the alphabet, each occurence of
the letter <TT>B</TT> by some other letter of the alphabet, and so
on. For example, one cryptogram of <TT>"TO BE OR NOT TO BE"</TT> is
<TT>"ZX OI XR AXZ ZX OI"</TT>. Another cryptogram of the same phrase
is <TT>"AB CD BE FBA AB CD"</TT>. More precisely, a cryptogram of some
text is the result of applying a function <I>f</I> to each letter of
the text, where <I>f</I> is a one-to-one function with domain and
range the 26 letters of the (English) alphabet. Let us call two words
"cryptoquivalent" if one is a cryptogram of the other. For example,
the words <TT>moon</TT> and <TT>iffy</TT> are cryptoquivalent, as are
<TT>space</TT> and any five-letter word with distinct letters. The
words <TT>all</TT> and <TT>cat</TT>, however, are not
cryptoquivalent. <P>The object of this problem is to find the groups
of cryptoquivalent words in a text.</P>

<P><STRONG>INPUT:</STRONG> Text containing words separated by single spaces or 
carriage returns, using only upper case English letters.</P>
<P><STRONG>OUTPUT:</STRONG> The same words, organized by placing cryptoquivalent 
words on the same line of output. The lines of output may be in any order, but 
the words within a line must appear in the order in which they appear in the 
input. Each word should appear in the output exactly as many times as it appears 
in the input. Your output should have no extra lines or spaces.</P>
