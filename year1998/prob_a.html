<center><h1>Problem A - Little Boxes</h1></center>

<p>Call a rectangular parallelepiped in 3-space a
<strong>regular box</strong> if its edges are parallel to the
coordinate axes.  A regular box can be
specified by giving the coordinates of the two points at the ends of
one main diagonal (a diagonal that does not lie within any face).</p>

<p>In this problem, you will be given some regular boxes and some
points, about which you will compile some information.</p>

<p><strong>INPUT:</strong> Specifies <b>N</b> regular boxes and
<b>M</b> points:</p>

<table border="2" width="80%" cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <td>Line 1</td>
    <td>An integer <b>N</b>, representing the number of regular boxes
        subsequently specified.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next <b>N</b> lines</td>
    <td>Six integers per line, the x, y and z coordinates of one point,
        followed by the x, y and z coordinates of a second point, these
        points specifying a regular box.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next line</td>
    <td>An integer <b>M</b>, representing the number of points
	    subsequently specified.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next (final) <b>M</b> lines</td>
    <td>Three integers per line, the x, y and z coordinates of a point.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<p>All numbers within a line will be separated by a single space, and
there will be no spaces after the last number in a line.  All the
coordinates given will be between -30,000 and 30,000, each box will have
positive volume, and there will be no duplicate boxes or duplicate points
specified.</p>

<p>In the output specifications, the words <strong>point(s)</strong>
and <strong>box(es)</strong> refer to the points and regular boxes
specified in the input.</p>


<p><strong>OUTPUT:</strong> Reports statistics about the relationships
between the points and the boxes, as follows:</p>

<table border="2" width="80%" cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <td>Line 1</td>
    <td>The greatest number of points lying within a single box.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Line 2</td>
    <td>The greatest number of boxes within which a single point
        lies.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Line 3</td>
    <td>The number of boxes that contain no point.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Line 4</td>
    <td>The number of points that lie within no box.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<p>Your output should contain numbers only, without explanatory words
or space characters.  You should consider a point lying on a face or
edge of a box <strong>not</strong> to be contained within that box.</p>
