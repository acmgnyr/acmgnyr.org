<P>A text file contains location information about international phone numbers.
Each piece of information in the file spans two consecutive lines, a 
<TT>CODE</TT> line (maximum length 6 characters) and a <TT>NAME</TT> line 
(maximum length 20 characters). Here's an example.</P><PRE>32

<P>Using this file, the location of an international phone number can be found. 
The location of an international phone number is the <TT>NAME</TT> that follows 
the <STRONG>longest</STRONG> <TT>CODE</TT> in the file that is a prefix of the 
phone number. Note that more than one <TT>CODE</TT> in the file can be a prefix 
of a given number, such as is the case with the codes <TT>33</TT> and 
<TT>331</TT> here.</P>
<P>Using the above example, we would identify <TT>349875750</TT> to be in the 
Canary Islands, <TT>3387657462</TT> in France, <TT>3314534383</TT> in Paris, 
etc.</P>

    <TD>Line 1</TD>
    <TD>An integer <B>N</B>, representing the number of <TT>CODE,NAME</TT>

  <TR>
    <TD>Line 2<B>N</B>+2</TD>
    <TD>An integer <B>M</B>, representing the number of phone numbers you must 
      look up. This number will not exceed 10.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Last <B>M</B> lines</TD>

<P><STRONG>OUTPUT:</STRONG></P>
<TABLE border=2 cellPadding=5 width="80%">
  <TBODY>
  <TR>
    <TD><B>M</B> lines</TD>
    <TD>The <B>M</B> locations of the phone numbers in the last <B>M</B> lines 
      of the input file, in the same order as the numbers appeared. You may 
      <STRONG>not</STRONG> assume that the location of each number can be found 
      in the input file. If, for some phone number, there is no prefix of the 
      number as a <TT>CODE</TT>, put <TT>UNKNOWN</TT> as the location in your 
      output.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
