<P>Curez-R-Us pharmacy uses many informational or warning labels on
the medications it dispenses, such as "Take with food", and "May cause
drowsiness". To keep track of which labels should be used with which
medications, Curez-R-Us maintains a text file. Each line of the file
is 94 characters long. The first 55 characters of each line contain
information about the medication, and the remaining 39 characters hold
up to 13 three-lefter codes for the labels that must be affixed when
that medication is dispensed. Specifically, the format of a line in
this file is as follows:</P>

<TABLE border=2 cellPadding=5 width="80%">
  <TBODY>
  <TR>
    <TD>Characters 1-5</TD>
    <TD>The Curez-R-Us unique 5-character identifier for the medication</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Characters 6-25</TD>
    <TD>The brand name for the medication, right-padded with spaces</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Characters 26-55</TD>
    <TD>The generic name for the medication, right-padded with spaces</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Characters 56-94</TD>
    <TD>Thirteen three-character fields, each containing either three blanks 
      or a three-digit label code. If a medication requires N labels, then the 
      codes for these labels fill the N leftmost label code fields. 
  </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>No medication currently requires more than thirteen informational or warning 
labels.</P>
<P>Although Curez-R-Us recently celebrated 27 years of faultless labeling, a 
database engineer has informed the pharmacy that it should reorganize the way in 
which its information is stored, and the pharmacy has reluctantly agreed to 
allow the engineer to modify its file. The engineer says that the information 
should be stored as follows: 
<P><STRONG>First part of the file [Medications]:</STRONG><BR>A sequence of 
55-character lines, the first 55 characters of each line of the original 
file.</P>
<P><STRONG>Second part of the file [What label goes where?]:</STRONG><BR>A 
sequence of 8-character lines, each containing a 5-character medication code 
xxxxx followed by a three-digit label code yyy, whenever yyy specifies a 
required label for medication xxxxx.</P>
<P><STRONG>INPUT:</STRONG> A file in the current Piliz-R-Us format.</P>
<P><STRONG>OUTPUT:</STRONG> A file in the proposed Pillz-R-Us format providing 
the same information. Within each part of the output file, the lines may be in 
any order.</P>
