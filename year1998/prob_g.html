<P>Define a <I>merge</I> of two strings to be any string formed from
all the characters in both strings, interspersed, but in their
original order. For example, for the strings <I>chocolate</I> and
<I>chips</I>, <I>cchocholaiptes</I> is a merge, but
<I>chocochilatspe</I> or <I>bananasplit</I> are not. This problem
requires writing a program that can tell if a given string is a merge
of two other given strings. For the purposes of this problem, the
input strings will contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.</P>

<P>The input file consists of three strings <I>A</I>, <I>B</I>, and
<I>C</I>, in that order, one string per line. The file contains no
blank lines, and the end of the input is marked by the end of the
file. The strings <I>A</I> and <I>B</I> will not exceed 1000
characters, and <I>C</I> will not exceed 2000 characters (rest assured
that input cases of this length <I>will</I> be tested).</P>

<P>If <I>C</I> is not a merge of <I>A</I> and <I>B</I>, write a single
line to the output file that reads <TT>"*** NOT A MERGE ***"</TT>. If
<I>C</I> is a merge, write to the output file the string <I>C</I>
rewriften with the characters from <I>A</I> in uppercase. If more than
one merge is possible, string <I>C</I> should be wriften with each
character of <I>A</I> occurring as early as possible (examine the
sample input below for such examples).</P>
