<a name="registration"><b>Registration</b></a>

<ol>
<li>
Team coaches must register the team contestants using the
<a href="http://www.acmicpc.org">ACM

Contact the Contest Director
immediately if there are any problems registering. Coaches may
register as many teams as they wish; however, not all teams may be
invited to participate. <br>
 
Each school is allowed to register one coach. Each team is allowed to
register three contestants. This means that if a school sends <i>n</i>
teams, it registers a total of 3<i>n</i>+1 people. <br>
 
Schools may register additional people at a cost of $30 per
person. This charge includes a t-shirt and food.
 
<li>
Four (4) weeks less one day prior to the Contest, the Contest Director
will invite registered teams to participate in the
Contest. This will be done by sending e-mail to the coaches.
 
<li>
Invited teams will be determined as follows: Of the teams registered
by the deadline, teams will be invited in the order in which they
registered, subject to the constraint that one team is invited from
all schools before two teams are invited from any school, two teams
are invited from all schools before three teams are invited from any
school, etc. As many teams will be invited as possible, subject to the
capacity of the site.
 
<li>
Coaches must send the registration fee of $70 per invited team plus
$30 per guest to the Contest Director.

  <ul>
  <li> Checks should be made payable to "ACM Greater NY Region" and sent to:<br>

</ol>

<a name="conduct"><b>Conduct of the Regional Contest</b></a>

<ol>
<li>
At least six problems will be posed.
 
<li>
Each team must have a faculty advisor and a coach, who may or may not
be the same person. The coach need not be a member of the faculty. The
faculty advisor needs to be able to verify the eligibility of the

<li>
Coaches and guests will have no contact with their teams during
the contest. The penalty for contact is immediate disqualification of

he or she must report this to the Contest Director for
an immediate ruling.
 
<li>
If the Contest Director or Head Judge decides that a clarification is
necessary, the Site Director will disseminate this information to all teams.
 
<li>
The Contest Director, Site Director(s), the Head Judge, and the
pool of team coaches present serve as the final authority for
resolving all local contest matters.
 
<li>

</ol>

<a name="pc2"><b>Electronic Submission with PC^2</b></a>

<ol>

<li>
Submission of problems will be electronic, with
<a href="http://www.ecs.csus.edu/pc2">PC^2 version 9</a>.
Please read the
<a href="http://www.ecs.csus.edu/pc2/pc2docs.html">Contestant's Guide</a>.
 
</ol>
 
<a name="judging"><b>Judging the Regional Contest</b></a>

<ol>
<li>
Teams will not be given the test input files that the judges will use
to determine program correctness.
 
<li>
Solutions to problems submitted for judging are called
<i>runs</i>. Each run is judged as <i>correct</i> or
incorrect, and the team is notified of the results.
Incorrect runs will be marked with one of the following comments. They
are listed in decreasing order of severity.

<ol>
<li> <i>file naming error</i>: The file naming convention was not
  followed. Either the submission was incorrectly named, or the
  program did not read from / write to the correctly named file.
<li> <i>compile error</i>: The program did not compile.
<li> <i>run-time error</i>: The program did not run to completion.
<li> <i>wrong answer</i>: This means that the program compiled and
  ran, but produced incorrect output.
<li> <i>time limit exceeded</i>: The program did not finish executing
  within the 2 minute time limit.
<li> <i>presentation error</i>: The output was nominally correct, but
  was not in the correct format.
</ol>

<li>
The Contest Judges are solely responsible for determining the correctness
of submitted runs. In consultation with the Contest Judges, the Chief Judge
is responsible for determining the winners of the contest. They
are empowered to adjust for or adjudicate unforeseen events and conditions.
Their decisions are final.

<li> The final contest results will be announced following the contest by the
Contest Director, Site Director, or Head Judge.

<li> Although they are unlikely, the Contest Director will resolve
ties by examining the quality of submitted solutions and number of
incorrect submissions.
